In the initial years of my life, I lived a very sheltered, conservative life, and was utterly repulsed by anything intense or thrilling, like roller coasters, explicit music, and scary movies. Then, when I was around 12 or 13 years old, I watched a TV-edited Friday the 13th marathon on the SyFy Channel, and it was all downhill from there. Now, at the age of 20, I absolutely relish films of the macabre, suspenseful, grotesque variety, and in fact, they are the main genre of movie that I watch.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">Fast forward to March 2020. I am 16 and in my Junior Year of High School. We have just been let out for an &ldquo;extended&rdquo; spring break, amidst the COVID 19 Pandemic. I do not think it was formally announced yet that school would be canceled for the rest of the year, but I did know that I was gonna be in my house for a while. So, one of the first things I did was take a trip up to my local Walmart 5 minutes down the road, and buy a seven film collection of a movie franchise that I have always wanted to watch since discovering my love for horror, which as you can expect from the title, was the Saw franchise. I went on a Saw marathon, watching one (occasionally 2) installments every night for about a week straight, starting with what was on my DVD collection, and ending with the latest at the time, Jigsaw, on Hulu, in preparation for the upcoming Spiral: The Book of Saw, which I also enjoyed despite some flaws.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c12">The Franchise</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">Saw quickly became one of my favorite film franchises of all time. I enjoyed all eight of the films I watched in that period. It was always so thrilling to see what kind of trap the (sometimes deserving) victims were going to be placed in, and what creative ways their limits were going to be tested next. The series is known for its plentiful and over the top gore effects, which is half of the fun. It is such a rollercoaster to wonder what kind of gnarly thing you are about to see happen, and when it does, it is an absolutely marvelous culmination of all the tension that has been building up within the scene. The Saw franchise is also known for its trademark, Shyamalan-esque twists, which are a guarantee at the end of every single movie, set to their iconic &ldquo;Hello Zepp&rdquo; theme music that plays during every big reveal.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">Saw X is the epitome of everything I love about the series. It has some monstrous brutality in its scenes, and has an extremely satisfying twist. However, this one actually goes above and beyond. It is not just another new Saw movie. It truly is a significant and powerful film in a way unlike any of the other entries, and also has a surprising amount of heart to it, while also giving inarguably the greatest and most beloved character in the series a long overdue, intimate, personal arc that serves as a love letter to him and his fans.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c12">The Movie</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">That character, of course, is John Kramer, AKA Jigsaw. Tobin Bell&rsquo;s iconic role as the main antagonist (and occasionally, as is evident in this particular movie, anti-hero) across almost the entirety of the franchise, takes center stage for Saw X. Never before in the series has Kramer ever gotten a story as focused, in-depth, and emotional as the one this movie gives us. [SPOILERS AHEAD]</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">As many Saw fans should know, Jigsaw has cancer. It is revealed in Saw II that he has been diagnosed, and is dying, and he finally kicks the bucket at the end of Saw III. Saw X takes place in between the events of Saw (the original) and Saw II. In X, we get to see his actual diagnosis at the beginning of the film, and the rest of it takes place directly after. Kramer is desperate to find a way to cure his disease, being given only months to live. He hears about a revolutionary treatment center in Mexico that the government doesn&rsquo;t want anyone to know about. He makes the trip, and rubs shoulders with a few characters that will become important later on. He gets the procedure done on him, and is ready to live the rest of his life cured, until he discovers that it was all a scam. The company had been advertising their services to numerous people, and tricking them into handing over large sums of money, promising their life in return, and each person he met at the treatment center was in on the scheme. What follows is the one and only Jigsaw doing what he does best. He kidnaps each individual person he met over the course of his &ldquo;treatment&rdquo; and places them in elaborate, excruciating traps to test their willingness to live with his signature &ldquo;game&rdquo;. His victims are subjected to horrifying physical torture in, as the movie officially claims in all of its promotion, &ldquo;his most personal game yet&rdquo;, and, as expected, there is a big twist at the end.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c12">Why it Rocks</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">The story that is being told alone, regardless of execution, gets points from me. It is such an incredible idea for a new Saw movie, and is something that has every reason to exist, rather than just being a &ldquo;cash grab&rdquo;. This should have been something that every fan of the franchise has been waiting for, and boy is it done remarkably well. This is by far the most amount of screen-time Tobin Bell&rsquo;s John Kramer has ever gotten, which is very welcome considering that his character was completely absent from the last installment, the Chris Rock led reimagining, Spiral: The Book of Saw. Never before in the other nine Saw movies has Jigsaw ever been a more fleshed out, sympathetic, and all around well written character. This is heavily supported by Tobin Bell&rsquo;s performance, undoubtedly the best of his career. Jigsaw is known for being a very monotone, intimidating, villainous figure that keeps his emotions suppressed, but in Saw X, he is more humanized than ever. Bell shows a full range of anger, despair, desperation, sentimentality, and compassion, which is a completely deranged thing to expect from a man who commits some of the acts upon others that he does in other installments of the series.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">The sentimentality I mentioned that Bell displays in his performance is aided by an also stunning performance from actress Shawnee Smith, who reprises her role as fan-favorite character Amanda, also known as Jigsaw&rsquo;s daughter and &ldquo;business&rdquo; partner. Similarly to John Kramer, her character is also the most-fleshed out it has ever been, and her dynamic with her father is a major highlight. They really sell the idea that they are family, and care about each other, which once again, is not something you would expect from such violent criminals. Believe it or not, the tenth entry in the horror movie franchise known for its graphic torture scenes and grisly blood and gore, has genuinely emotional moments that tug at your heartstrings.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">Now, the unexpected presence of the mushy stuff does not mean there is a lack of Saw&rsquo;s signature blood, guts, and gore. I&rsquo;m a sucker for the elaborate and agonizing traps that the series has no shortage of. It&rsquo;s so fascinating to see the creativity from the filmmakers that resulted in the design of these complex, painful devices. Saw X brings the pain once again. There are a total of 6 traps in this one, and they are mostly a hit. The last two traps are a bit underwhelming, although the final trap gets a pass from me because it is presented to us mid-twist, and as a result, the stakes are much higher. Overall, X offers some of the most brutal moments of the series to date.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">In addition to the emotion, something else that Saw X did that is a rarity across the rest of the series is seeing the mighty Jigsaw in a (perceived) moment of weakness. Most of the franchise depicts John Kramer as being this untouchable figure that cannot be stopped in his quest for teaching morbid lessons to those who have wronged others. Even after he dies in Saw III his games continue past his death and Jigsaw becomes much more than the man. But in Saw X, it actually makes you believe that John Kramer might have been outsmarted, and considering how much the movie makes you feel sympathy for him, it is incredibly saddening, especially with how horrible the people who wronged him are. It really hurt me to believe that it was true. However, myself being a diehard &ldquo;Sawhead&rdquo;, a part of me just did not buy it. Sure enough, the &ldquo;Hello Zepp&rdquo; theme began playing, and let&rsquo;s just say I was more than satisfied at the twist. Those final moments wrap the story up in a beautiful, blood-covered bow.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">Saw X is a high point, not just for the Saw franchise, but 2023 horror movies as a whole. As a long-time horror fan myself, I find much delight in this particular collection of films, and this newest iteration is everything that I love and more. It goes beyond just a good sequel, and truly crafts a special and memorable story that other legacy horror IPs should take notes from.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c4">Keywords: Horror, Saw X, Movies, Thriller, Jigsaw</span></p></body></html>
